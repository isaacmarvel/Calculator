# Calculator
https://isaacmarvel.github.io/Calculator/
Regular old calculator. Works with keypresses as well. I also made the javascript for a backspace button, but didn't quite fit it into the design. But, backspace still works via the keyboard. The JS could stand to be refactored, but otherwise haven't noticed any bugs.
